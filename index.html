            <p>We buying grains like wheat, rice, and oats in bulk might seem like an appealing (and affordable) option
                for building emergency food storage, it's best to take that route only if you're comfortable cooking

            <p>Traditionally, embankments are most commonly used as shelters during floods. Considering the geography of
                the country and the amount of floodwater that passes through it during the monsoon period, it may easily
                be seen that building embankments are not feasible in many areas of the country.</p>
